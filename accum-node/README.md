# ACCUM Node Primitives (Rust)

This crate implements the core data structures and basic validation logic for the ACCUM node,
following the provided `SPEC.md`:

- **Constants**: monetary units, time parameters, PoW parameters, PoCI weights, difficulty, governance.
- **Blocks**: block header, block structure, Merkle root computation, basic block validation.
- **Transactions**: inputs/outputs, txid calculation, fee/dust rules, coinbase checks.
- **Consensus**: PoCI (Proof-of-Contribution Index), loyalty and bond handling, difficulty adjustment.
- **P2P**: protocol message enums and share packet validation.

## Crate Layout

- `constants.rs` – protocol constants.
- `types.rs` – shared type aliases and difficulty target wrapper.
- `error.rs` – unified error type.
- `blocks.rs` – `BlockHeader`, `Block`, PoW hashing, Merkle tree, `validate_block`.
- `transactions.rs` – `TxIn`, `TxOut`, `Transaction`, txid, fee/dust validation.
- `consensus.rs` – PoCI computation, rewards, loyalty updates, difficulty adjustment.
- `p2p.rs` – message types, share packet validation.

## Status

This is a **reference implementation** focused on correctness and clarity rather than performance.
It omits networking, storage, and a full UTXO set; those can be built on top of these primitives.

1. Introduction
ACCUM is a next‑generation blockchain protocol built on an innovative consensus mechanism called Fair Proof‑of‑Contribution (F‑PoC). The protocol addresses the structural weaknesses of classical Proof‑of‑Work, while preserving its strengths: decentralization, openness, and objective security.

ACCUM solves classical PoW problems by redefining reward distribution. Instead of rewarding only the miner who finds a block, ACCUM distributes rewards across three independent axes of contribution:

• Shares — computational work (60%)
• Loyalty — long‑term participation (20%)
• Bond — economic commitment (20%)

2. Monetary Model
2.1 Basic Parameters
Parameter	Value
Base unit	ACM (Accum)
Minimal unit	Lyator (LYT)
Exchange rate	1 ACM = 10,000,000 LYT
All protocol values	uint64 in LYT
Maximum supply	150,000,000 ACM
Block reward	500,000 LYT (0.05 ACM)
Epoch reward	720,000,000 LYT (72 ACM)
Block time	60 seconds (target)
Epoch length	1440 blocks (24 hours)
Annual inflation (Year 1)	0.0175%
2.2 Monetary Transparency
Annual supply = 72 × 365 × 10⁷ + 0.05 × 365 × 24 × 60 × 10⁷ LYT
= 262,800,000,000 LYT + 1,576,800,000 LYT
= 264,376,800,000 LYT/year = 26.44 ACM/year

Inflation = 26.44 / 150,000,000 = 0.0176% (confirmed)

3. Cryptographic Parameters
3.1 Proof‑of‑Work Function: Argon2id
Parameter	Value	Rationale
Memory	256 MiB	ASIC‑resistance: requires $50K+ for ASIC
Iterations	2	Balance: ~100ms on modern CPU
Parallelism	4	Optimal for 4‑8 core CPUs
Version	0x13	Argon2id (not Argon2d, not Argon2i)
Type	Argon2id	Hybrid approach: protection against GPU and ASIC
Hash output	256 bits	Full entropy for difficulty
3.2 Performance Benchmarks
Hardware	Time/Hash	Throughput	Cost/Hash
CPU (Ryzen 7 5700X)	~110 ms	9.1 H/s	$0.00001/H
CPU (Intel i7‑12700K)	~95 ms	10.5 H/s	$0.0000095/H
GPU (RTX 3090)	~45 ms	22 H/s	$0.0000045/H
Hypo. Argon2 ASIC	~5 ms	200 H/s	$0.00001/H (unachievable)
Conclusion: GPU has 2‑3x advantage, but not radical. CPU remains competitive.

3.3 Why Not Other Functions?
Alternative	Problem
SHA256	Vulnerable to ASIC (Bitcoin‑style)
RandomX	Harder to implement, less standardized
scrypt	Less memory (32 KB), more vulnerable to ASIC
Balloon	Slower than Argon2id
CryptoNight	Dead (Monero switched to RandomX)
Argon2id — standardized (RFC 9106), tested, optimal.

4. Block Structure
4.1 Block Header (120 bytes, little‑endian)
Field	Type	Size	Description
version	uint32	4	Block version (current: 1)
prev_hash	[32]byte	32	Argon2id hash of previous block header
merkle_root	[32]byte	32	Root of transaction Merkle tree
timestamp	uint64	8	Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970‑01‑01)
difficulty	[32]byte	32	Compact target representation
nonce	uint64	8	Nonce for Proof‑of‑Work
epoch_index	uint32	4	Current epoch number (starting at 1)
Total: 120 bytes

All fields in little‑endian.

4.2 Block Validity
text
hash = Argon2id(header_bytes)
Block is valid if:

hash < target_block (meets network difficulty)

timestamp > median(last_11_blocks.timestamp)

timestamp < now + 2 hours (protection against time‑warp attacks)

merkle_root correct for all transactions in block

First transaction is valid coinbase

No double‑spend (same input cannot appear twice in a block)

Block height = prev_height + 1

5. Shares and Proof-of-Contribution
5.1 Share Validity
text
hash = Argon2id(header_bytes)
Share is valid if: hash < target_share

Protocol rule:

text
target_share = target_block << 8
This means each found block corresponds to ~256 valid shares, ensuring low reward variance and making solo mining viable.

5.2 Share Packet (P2P, 180 bytes)
Field	Type	Size	Description
miner_id	[20]byte	20	RIPEMD160(SHA256(compressed_pubkey))
header	[120]byte	120	Complete block header
nonce	uint64	8	Nonce that produced valid share
hash	[32]byte	32	Computed Argon2id hash
Total: 180 bytes

All fields in little‑endian.

5.3 Share Limits
Maximum shares per miner per epoch:

text
MAX_SHARES_PER_MINER_PER_EPOCH = 5000
Shares exceeding this limit are ignored.

5.4 Share Validation on Node
Upon receiving share packet:

Verify miner_id length = 20 bytes

Validate packet structure

Perform cheap pre‑filter:

text
prefilter = SHA256(header || nonce)
If prefilter > share_prefilter_target, reject without computing Argon2.

Recompute hash = Argon2id(header)

Compare recomputed hash with received hash field. If mismatch → reject (invalid share)

Verify hash < target_share

Verify that header.prev_hash references a valid block

Add share to current epoch pool for miner_id

Rate-limit per peer: max 100 shares/minute, ban for 5 minutes if exceeded.

Optimization: Nodes cache Argon2id results for 60 seconds to avoid recomputation for the same header.

5.5 Invalid Share Monitoring
Node tracks invalid_shares / total_shares per miner_id.

Thresholds:

>10% → warning

>30% → automatic slash tx creation with Merkle proof (at least 10 invalid shares)

6. Miner Identity
text
miner_id = RIPEMD160(SHA256(compressed_secp256k1_pubkey))
Properties:
• Compatible with Bitcoin P2PKH addresses
• Deterministic: one public key = one miner_id
• Cryptographically secure
• Can be verified, but cannot be reversed

All PoCI accruals and rewards are strictly tied to miner_id.

7. Bond (Economic Commitment)
7.1 Parameters
Parameter	Value	Rationale
Minimum for PoCI	1 ACM = 10,000,000 LYT	Economic barrier
Lock‑up period	20,160 blocks	~14 days
Bond weight in PoCI	20%	Economic alignment
7.2 Bond Mechanism
Bond is created through a special bond output:

text
scriptPubKey = OP_BOND
Properties:
• Bond output cannot be spent until lock_height + 20,160
• Multiple bond outputs from the same miner_id accumulate
• Bond participates in PoCI only if >= MINIMUM_BOND_LYT

7.3 Bond Weight in PoCI
If bond_i >= MINIMUM_BOND_LYT:

text
norm_bond_i = sqrt(bond_i) / sqrt(max_bond_in_epoch)
If bond_i < MINIMUM_BOND_LYT:

text
norm_bond_i = 0 (no contribution)
Example:

Miner A: bond = 1 ACM (10M LYT) → norm_bond_A = sqrt(10M) / sqrt(50M) = 3162 / 7071 = 0.447

Miner B: bond = 5 ACM (50M LYT) → norm_bond_B = sqrt(50M) / sqrt(50M) = 1.0

Miner C: bond = 0 ACM (0 LYT) → norm_bond_C = 0

7.4 Slashing (100% Bond Burn)
Bond is burned in the following cases:

7.4.1 Equivocation Detection
Definition: Miner signs two different blocks at the same height.

Detection Mechanism:

Any node notices two blocks at height H from the same miner_id

Creates a special tx of type SLASH_EQUIVOCATION with both headers

Broadcasts this tx to the network

When included in a block: all bond of this miner_id is burned

Event is logged on blockchain (irreversible)

Protection Against False Accusations:
• If SLASH_EQUIVOCATION tx is incorrect (headers from different heights), tx is rejected by validators
• Nodes verify headers before accepting slash‑tx

7.4.2 Invalid Share Flooding
Definition: Miner publishes known invalid shares, with invalid/total ratio exceeding 30% in an epoch.

Detection Mechanism:

Nodes track all shares from each miner_id

If invalid_shares / total_shares > 0.3, a tx of type SLASH_INVALID_SHARES is created

Transaction contains Merkle proof of at least 10 invalid shares

When included in a block: all bond of this miner_id is burned

Protection Against False Accusations:
• Nodes verify each share in the proof before accepting slash‑tx
• Proof must show shares are from same epoch and miner

7.4.3 Proven 51% Attack (Future Upgrade)
Mechanism to be defined in ACCUM v3.3 after network stability and experience.

7.5 Bond Scaling with Network Growth
Phase	Market Cap (example)	1 ACM in USD (example)	Bond in USD	Sybil Protection
Launch	$5M	$0.033	$0.033	Low (no barrier)
Growth	$150M	$1.00	$1.00	Medium
Maturity	$1.5B	$10.00	$10.00	High
Enterprise	$5B+	$33+	$33+	Very High
Key Conclusion: Bond in LYT remains fixed (1 ACM), but its USD value grows with market capitalization. This automatically scales Sybil protection without code changes.

8. Loyalty (Long-term Participation)
8.1 Mechanism (Softened Decay)
Initial value:

text
loyalty_i = 0
Epoch participation (≥ 1 valid share):

text
loyalty_i = loyalty_i + 1
Missed epoch (no valid shares):

text
loyalty_i = max(loyalty_i * 0.7, loyalty_i // 2)
Grace period: First 3 missed epochs after returning from absence use decay factor 0.5 (to allow faster recovery).

8.2 Examples
Scenario A: Continuous Participation

text
Epoch 1: 0 → 1 (participation)
Epoch 2: 1 → 2 (participation)
Epoch 3: 2 → 3 (participation)
Epoch 4: 3 → 4 (participation)
→ After one year: loyalty ≈ 365
Scenario B: Intermittent Participation

text
Epoch 1: 0 → 1 (participation)
Epoch 2: 1 → 0 (missed) [1//2 = 0]
Epoch 3: 0 → 1 (participation)
→ Loyalty quickly recovers
Scenario C: Long Break

text
Epoch 1‑100: loyalty = 100 (continuous participation)
Epoch 101: 100 → 70 (missed, *0.7)
Epoch 102: 70 → 49 (missed, *0.7)
Epoch 103: 49 → 34 (missed, *0.7)
Epoch 104: 34 → 17 (missed, //2)
Epoch 105: 17 → 8 (missed, //2)
... (slower reset, ~10-12 missed epochs to near-zero)
Conclusion: Loyalty cannot be "frozen" for a long time, but now has a realistic buffer for interruptions.

8.3 Loyalty Normalization in PoCI
text
norm_loyalty_i = loyalty_i / max_loyalty_in_epoch
9. PoCI (Proof-of-Contribution Index)
9.1 Basic Formula
text
PoCI_i = 0.6 × norm_shares_i + 0.2 × norm_loyalty_i + 0.2 × norm_bond_i
Weights:
• 0.6 (60%) for shares — primary contribution (computational work)
• 0.2 (20%) for loyalty — network stability
• 0.2 (20%) for bond — economic alignment

9.2 Component Normalization
text
norm_X_i = X_i / max_X_in_epoch
For each component (shares, loyalty, bond): max_X_in_epoch = maximum value among all miners in the epoch

9.3 Shares Normalization = Square Root
To prevent dominance by a single large miner, sub-linear normalization is used:

text
shares_raw_i = number of valid shares from miner i in the epoch
norm_shares_i = sqrt(shares_raw_i) / max_sqrt_in_epoch
Where: max_sqrt_in_epoch = max(sqrt(shares_raw_j) for all j)

Rationale:
• Square root is less aggressive than logarithm
• Preserves differentiation between miners
• Prevents monopoly of one miner on the shares component
• Balances with other components (loyalty, bond)

Example:

Miner A: 10000 shares → sqrt(10000) = 100
Miner B: 2500 shares → sqrt(2500) = 50
Miner C: 1600 shares → sqrt(1600) = 40

max_sqrt = 100

text
norm_shares_A = 100/100 = 1.0
norm_shares_B = 50/100 = 0.5
norm_shares_C = 40/100 = 0.4
Conclusion: Despite Miner A having 6.25x more shares than Miner C, their normalized contribution is only 2.5x greater. This is fairer.

9.4 Bond Normalization = Square Root
text
bond_raw_i = total bond amount for miner i in the epoch (LYT)
norm_bond_i = sqrt(bond_raw_i) / max_sqrt_bond_in_epoch
Where: max_sqrt_bond_in_epoch = max(sqrt(bond_raw_j) for all j)

9.5 Reward Based on PoCI
text
reward_i = (PoCI_i / sum_PoCI) × (EPOCH_REWARD_LYT + tx_fees)
Where:

sum_PoCI = Σ(PoCI_j for all j)

EPOCH_REWARD_LYT = 720,000,000 LYT (72 ACM)

9.6 PoCI Calculation Example
Given: Epoch 50, three miners: A, B, C

Miner A:

shares_raw = 10,000

loyalty = 100

bond = 5 ACM (50M LYT)

text
sqrt(shares_raw) = 100
max_sqrt_shares = 100
norm_shares_A = 100/100 = 1.0

max_loyalty = 100
norm_loyalty_A = 100/100 = 1.0

sqrt(bond) = sqrt(50M) = 7071
max_sqrt_bond = 7071
norm_bond_A = 7071/7071 = 1.0

PoCI_A = 0.6×1.0 + 0.2×1.0 + 0.2×1.0 = 1.0
Miner B:

shares_raw = 2500

loyalty = 50

bond = 1 ACM (10M LYT)

text
sqrt(2500) = 50
norm_shares_B = 50/100 = 0.5

norm_loyalty_B = 50/100 = 0.5

sqrt(bond) = sqrt(10M) = 3162
norm_bond_B = 3162/7071 = 0.447

PoCI_B = 0.6×0.5 + 0.2×0.5 + 0.2×0.447 = 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.0894 = 0.4894
Miner C:

shares_raw = 1600

loyalty = 10

bond = 0 (below minimum)

text
sqrt(1600) = 40
norm_shares_C = 40/100 = 0.4

norm_loyalty_C = 10/100 = 0.1

bond < MINIMUM_BOND → norm_bond_C = 0

PoCI_C = 0.6×0.4 + 0.2×0.1 + 0.2×0 = 0.24 + 0.02 + 0 = 0.26
Reward Calculation:

text
sum_PoCI = 1.0 + 0.4894 + 0.26 = 1.7494

reward_A = (1.0 / 1.7494) × 720M LYT = 411.6M LYT = 41.16 ACM
reward_B = (0.4894 / 1.7494) × 720M LYT = 201.4M LYT = 20.14 ACM
reward_C = (0.26 / 1.7494) × 720M LYT = 107.0M LYT = 10.70 ACM

Total = 720M LYT
10. Share Synchronization Between Nodes
10.1 Share Pool on Node
Each node maintains a share pool for the current epoch:

text
share_pool = {
    miner_id_1: [share1, share2, ...],
    miner_id_2: [share3, share4, ...],
    ...
}
Memory Usage:
• Average case: ~1000 miners × ~1000 shares/miner = 1M shares
• Share size = 180 bytes
• Total: ~180 MB per epoch
• Acceptable for modern nodes

10.2 P2P Share Propagation
When receiving a share packet from a peer:

Validate share

Check that share is not duplicate (by hash)

Add to local share pool

Broadcast share to other peers (flooding with TTL=5)

Optimization: Nodes cache Argon2id results for 60 seconds to avoid recomputation.

10.3 Epoch Commit Message
At epoch end (after block N+1439):

Node computes Merkle tree of all shares in the epoch

Computes root: epoch_commit_root = Merkle(all_shares)

Broadcast message: epoch_commit { epoch_index, root, timestamp }

Peers use epoch_commit for synchronization and verification.

If local root != received root:
• Node requests missing shares via getdata
• If difference > 10%, node enters resync mode

10.4 Resync Mechanism
If node falls behind in shares:

Send getdata to peers requesting shares for the epoch

Peers send shares (maximum 1000 at a time)

Validate each share

After receiving sufficient quantity (>90% of expected), return to normal mode

10.5 Share Pool Management and Conflict Resolution
10.5.1 Storage Optimization
Shares are stored in an in-memory map with key miner_id: Vec<Share> (maximum 10,000 shares per miner_id to limit memory usage).

If share pool exceeds 500 MB, oldest shares (earliest by timestamp) are spilled to disk (LevelDB or RocksDB, key = epoch_index:miner_id:share_hash).

After epoch_commit: shares are archived (only Merkle root is kept in-memory for fast verification).

10.5.2 Conflict Resolution for Epoch Commit Root
Upon receiving epoch_commit from a peer: compare local_root with received_root.

If mismatch: request getshares (message: getshares { epoch_index, miner_id_list (optional for delta), offset }).

Peers reply with sharereply { shares_batch (max 500 shares per reply) } with backoff (1 second delay after 3 requests).

Resolution: majority vote on root from connected peers (minimum 5 peers). If local_root is in minority — resync with majority root.

Ban peers with persistent mismatch (>3 times in 10 epochs) for 1 hour.

10.5.3 Rate-Limiting for Resync
Limit: max 10 resync requests per peer per epoch.

If discrepancy >20%, node enters "observer mode" (no mining, only synchronizing) for 5 minutes.

11. Difficulty Adjustment
11.1 Parameters
Parameter	Value
Adjustment interval	every 120 blocks
Target interval time	7,200 seconds (120 blocks × 60 seconds)
Adjustment function	linear adjustment
Bounds	±25% per adjustment
11.2 Formula
text
new_target = old_target × (actual_time_span / 7200)
Where: actual_time_span = timestamp[block_N+119] - timestamp[block_N]

Bound application:

text
if new_target > old_target × 1.25: new_target = old_target × 1.25  // Maximum +25%
if new_target < old_target × 0.75: new_target = old_target × 0.75  // Maximum -25%
11.3 Protection Against Time‑Warp Attacks
Validation check on block:

text
timestamp[i] > median(timestamp[i-1..i-11])
This prevents dramatic timestamp jumps.

11.4 Expected Behavior
Scenario: Hashrate doubles between adjustments

text
old_target = 0x00000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
actual_time = 7200 / 2 = 3600 sec (blocks found 2x faster)
new_target = old_target × (3600 / 7200) = old_target × 0.5
After bound: new_target = old_target × 0.75 (maximum -25%)
Result:

Blocks will be 25% faster than target

Next adjustment: difficulty adjusts again

Conclusion: System stabilizes in 2‑3 adjustments.

12.4 Supported Scripts
P2PKH (Pay‑to‑Public‑Key‑Hash):

text
scriptPubKey = OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <20-byte hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Standard Bitcoin format.

P2PK (Pay‑to‑Public‑Key):

text
scriptPubKey = <public key> OP_CHECKSIG
More compact than P2PKH.

Multisig (1‑of‑n):

text
scriptPubKey = OP_1 <pubkey1> ... <pubkeyn> OP_n OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Requires m of n signatures.

Timelocks:

OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY — Absolute timelocks (block/time)

OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY — Relative timelocks

Bond Output (Special):

text
scriptPubKey = OP_BOND
Locks coins as bond for 20,160 blocks.

Slash Outputs (Special):

text
scriptPubKey = OP_SLASH_EQUIVOCATION
scriptPubKey = OP_SLASH_INVALID_SHARES
12.5 Validation Rules
Rule	Description
Balance Rule	∑(inputs) >= ∑(outputs) + fee (no coin creation)
Minimum Fee	fee >= 50 LYT
Dust Limit	Outputs < 100 LYT are considered non‑standard and may be rejected
Signature Validation	ECDSA secp256k1, SIGHASH_ALL (signature covers entire transaction)
No Double‑Spend	Same input cannot appear twice in one block
Script Execution	scriptSig must only contain push data (no opcodes) for standard tx
12.6 Coinbase Transaction (Optimized for Scale)
The first transaction in each block is coinbase.

Structure:

text
input[0].prev_txid = [0; 32] (all zeros)
input[0].prev_index = 0xFFFFFFFF
input[0].scriptSig = arbitrary data (maximum 100 bytes)

outputs = [
    { value: block_reward, scriptPubKey: standard },
    { value: epoch_reward_1, scriptPubKey: to_miner_1 },
    { value: epoch_reward_2, scriptPubKey: to_miner_2 },
    ...
]
Payout Logic:

If number of payout miners ≤ 1000: all rewards are placed in a single coinbase transaction with multiple outputs.

If > 1000 miners: rewards are split into a chain of payout transactions:

First coinbase output goes to a "payout accumulator" address.

Separate transactions in the same block distribute rewards in batches of up to 1000 outputs per transaction.

Payout accumulator uses a special script: OP_PAYOUT_ACCUM (locked for 1 block to prevent reorg attacks).

Transaction fees for extra payout transactions are covered from the epoch's collected transaction fees. If insufficient, the fee is deducted from the total reward pool (but not exceeding 1% of total reward).

At epoch boundaries (block 1440, 2880, ...):
• First output = block_reward (0.05 ACM) for the miner who found the block
• Remaining outputs = PoCI rewards for the completed epoch

Nodes request unknown objects via getdata

Objects are transmitted (block, tx, share)

Periodically: ping/pong for connection health

At epoch boundaries: epoch_commit broadcast

Optimizations:

After inv, use bloom filters for shares to avoid duplicates.

Rate-limiting: max 1000 messages/hour per peer for shares/getshares.

ping includes nonce for accurate latency measurement. Response time <2 seconds, otherwise disconnect.

14.3 Share Relay
Nodes propagate shares through P2P network:

Miner finds valid share

Creates share packet (180 bytes)

Broadcast to P2P network (flooding with TTL=5)

Peers validate and propagate further

Share enters each node's share pool

Optimization: Nodes can use Bloom filters to avoid share duplication.

15. Epoch Lifecycle
15.1 Epoch Structure
Epoch N consists of blocks numbered [N×1440, N×1440+1439].

Epoch 1: blocks 0‑1439

Epoch 2: blocks 1440‑2879

Epoch 3: blocks 2880‑4319

...

15.2 During Epoch (Blocks 0‑1439)
Miners:
• Perform Argon2id(header)
• If hash < target_block → block found, broadcast
• If hash < target_share → share found, broadcast
• Receive block_reward (0.05 ACM) for found block

Nodes:
• Validate all blocks and shares
• Maintain share pool for current epoch
• Track loyalty of each miner
• Track bond of each miner

15.3 At Epoch Boundary (Block 1440)
Network stops accepting shares for epoch N

PoCI calculated for each miner:

text
PoCI_i = 0.6 × norm_shares_i + 0.2 × norm_loyalty_i + 0.2 × norm_bond_i
Reward calculated for each miner:

text
reward_i = (PoCI_i / sum_PoCI) × (720M LYT + tx_fees)
If number of miners > 1000: generate batch transactions (each with up to 1000 outputs) and include them in the first block of the new epoch after the coinbase.

First block of new epoch contains coinbase with block_reward + payout outputs or accumulator output.

15.4 New Epoch Start (Block 1440+)
• share pool cleared
• loyalty counters updated (decay for miners who missed epoch)
• bond weights remain unchanged (until lock period expires)
• New epoch begins
• Difficulty adjusted based on previous 120 blocks time

16. Security
16.1 ASIC‑Resistance
Mechanism: Argon2id with 256 MB memory

Analysis:
• ASIC for Argon2id would require 256 MB on‑chip memory
• Cost of such ASIC: $50,000+ per chip
• Amortization: ~2 years for ROI
• CPU: $500 × 2 years = $1000 < $50,000 ASIC

Conclusion: ASIC economically unviable. CPU remains competitive.

16.2 Protection Against Pool Centralization
Mechanism: Low reward variance

Analysis:
• In classical PoW: small miner may wait months for reward
• In ACCUM: small miner receives reward every epoch (24 hours)
• Variance: very low (proportional to PoCI)

Conclusion: Solo mining is viable. Pools lose structural advantage.

16.3 Sybil‑Resistance
Mechanism: Minimum bond (1 ACM)

Analysis:
• To create 1000 miner_id requires locking 1000 ACM
• Bond for 14 days, then can be returned and reused
• But during 14 days: 1000 ACM × 14 days = 14,000 ACM‑days locked

Conclusion: Sybil attacks become expensive. Cost grows with network market cap.

16.4 Anti‑Burst Mining
Mechanism: Loyalty decay

Analysis:
• Miner who mines only on some days loses loyalty
• Loyalty decreases by 50% for each missed day
• After 7 days absence: loyalty = 0

Conclusion: "Hit‑and‑run" strategies are ineffective. Long‑term participation is rewarded.

16.5 51% Attack
Requirements for Success:

51% of all epoch shares (computational control)

Proportional loyalty (long‑term participation)

Proportional bond (economic commitment)

Attack Cost:

Case	Cost
Classical PoW (Bitcoin)	~$10‑50B in hardware
ACCUM	$20B + unachievable loyalty + bond burning
Conclusion: 51% attack in ACCUM is economically infeasible even for the richest adversaries.

17. Governance
17.1 Philosophy
ACCUM is built on the principle of gradual decentralization. The protocol evolves with the network, transferring control to the community as it grows.

17.2 Phase 1: Foundational Governance (Blocks 0‑100,000, ~6 months)
Founders have the right to make strategic decisions for:
• Rapid response to critical vulnerabilities
• Parameter adjustments based on real network data
• Attack prevention in early stages

Limitations on Founder Power:
• All changes must be published as ACCUM Improvement Proposals (AIPs)
• Minimum 14 days before activation
• Each change must include rationale and security audit
• Community petition (signed by 100+ miner_ids) can delay changes for 7 days

17.3 Phase 2: Hybrid Governance (Blocks 100,001‑500,000, ~1.5 years)
First elements of decentralized governance:

Advisory Votes:
• Community gains right to non‑binding votes on key parameters
• Votable parameters:

PoCI weights (0.6/0.2/0.2)

Minimum bond

Epoch length
• Founders must publicly explain any decision contrary to majority will

Validator Council:
• 7 validators elected by the community
• Right to veto changes affecting security
• Can delay change for 30 days for audit

17.4 Phase 3: Full DAO Decentralization (Blocks 500,001+, ~2.5+ years)
Full transfer of control to the community:

Actors:

Role	Composition	Authority
Validators	Node operators	Technical upgrades
Token Holders	All ACM owners	Economic parameters
Security Council	9 elected experts	Emergency actions
Voting Mechanism:

Vote weight:
• Economic matters: 1 ACM = 1 vote (quadratic weighting)
• Technical matters: weighted by PoCI share
• Security: Security Council only

Procedure:

AIP published on forum (7 days discussion)

Author deposits 1000 ACM (returned if successful, burned if rejected)

Voting lasts 7 days

Approval: >50% votes + >30% participation

7‑day timelock before activation

Votable Parameters:

Category	Examples	Change Frequency
PoCI weights	0.6/0.2/0.2	No more than once/year
Bond	Minimum bond	No more than once/6 months
Epoch length	1440 blocks	No more than once/year
Fee market	Minimum fee	No more than once/3 months
Treasury	Fund allocation	Any time
17.5 Economic Security of Governance
Protection Against Vote Buying:
• Quadratic voting: vote cost increases exponentially
• Minimum holding period: 7 days before voting
• Cannot vote with recently acquired coins

Protection Against Malicious Proposals:
• Author deposit: 1000 ACM (burned if rejected)
• Security Council can veto dangerous proposals
• Mandatory public report on veto reasons

17.6 Transparency and Accountability
All votes, proposals, and decisions are recorded on the blockchain. Historical records are available for audit by any network participant. Security Council publishes quarterly reports on its activities.

17.7 Fork Mechanism
ACCUM does not prevent forks. Any participant may create a fork of the protocol. ACCUM recognizes the community's right to separate, provided basic consensus rules are followed.

18. Implementation Notes
18.1 Data Types
All monetary amounts MUST be stored as 64‑bit unsigned integers (uint64_t), representing LYT.

Maximum value: 2^64 - 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 LYT

Maximum ACCUM: 150,000,000 ACM = 1,500,000,000,000,000 LYT

Ratio: 1,500,000,000,000,000 / 2^64 ≈ 0.0000814 (safe)

18.3 Serialization
• All integers are serialized in little‑endian order
• Variable‑length data uses Bitcoin‑style VarInt prefix
• Hashes are serialized as raw bytes (no hex conversion)

18.4 Error Handling
Implementations MUST use checked arithmetic to prevent overflow/underflow. All monetary operations must validate against maximum supply.

Example (in Rust):

rust
fn add_balance(balance: &mut u64, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    *balance = balance.checked_add(amount)
        .ok_or(Error::Overflow)?;
    
    if *balance > MAX_SUPPLY_LYT {
        return Err(Error::ExceedsMaxSupply);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}

20.3 Vision
ACCUM establishes a new standard for fairness in decentralized networks. By rewarding not just computational power, but also long‑term commitment and economic alignment, the protocol creates a more equitable mining environment where:

• Individual CPU miners can compete effectively
• Long‑term contributors are appropriately rewarded
• Attacks become economically infeasible
• The network remains truly decentralized
• Value accrues to those who build and maintain the network

Appendices
Appendix A: Calculation Examples
A.1 PoCI Calculation Example
(Provided in section 9.6)

A.2 Slashing Example
Scenario: Miner D attempts equivocation attack

Block 5000 (height):

Miner D signs Block A (version=1, prev_hash=X)

Miner D also signs Block B (version=1, prev_hash=Y)

Both at height 5000!

Detection:

Node notices two different blocks from same miner_id at same height

Node creates tx of type SLASH_EQUIVOCATION with both headers

Node broadcasts this tx to network

Validation:
Validators check:

Block A.height == Block B.height == 5000 ✓

Block A.header != Block B.header ✓

Block A.miner_id == Block B.miner_id == D ✓

Block A.hash < target_block ✓

Block B.hash < target_block ✓

Result:

Miner D's bond is completely burned

If bond = 10 ACM, then 10 ACM is destroyed

Event is logged on blockchain

Miner D can continue mining, but without bond (until creating a new one)

Hypothetical ASIC	256MB	5ms	200 H/s	50W	$0.000005
Note: Hypothetical ASIC shows that even if someone creates a specialized chip, its advantage would be only 5‑8x (instead of 1000x for SHA256). At ASIC cost of $50,000+, ROI is unjustified.
